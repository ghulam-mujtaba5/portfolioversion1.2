## 🗂 Project Structure

Key files and directories:

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and npm

### Install
```bash
npm install
```

### Run (Development)
```bash
npm start
```
The app typically serves at `http://localhost:3000/`.

### Build (Production)
```bash
npm run build
```
This outputs optimized assets to the `build/` directory.

### Deploy
- Push to a Git repo and import into Vercel
- Or deploy the `build/` folder to any static host
